The Channel Sales Director has asked the analyst to analyse the data in these tables and come up 
with insights. The Director is interested mainly in what is the general reaction of our customers and 
visitors about our products. To aid your thinking, the Director looks at things like products well 
received, products not appreciated at all, opinion towards shops and product discounts etc. to 
name a few. Please understand that this is an open ended task and your ingenuity and out of the 
box thinking in unearthing insights is what we are looking for. An exploratory data analysis with lots 
of easy to understand visualisation and data handling is what we are looking for at this stage. No 
modelling is expected"
